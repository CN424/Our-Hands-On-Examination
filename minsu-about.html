	  <p>The Mindoro State University (MinSU) was originally the Mindoro
	  National Agricultural School (MINAS) created by R.A. 506 as a 
	  national agricultural secondary school in the island of Mindoro. It
	  formally opened Hs doors for learning on August 26, 1951.In 1963, by
	  authority of R.A. 3758 it opened the Collegiate Department. This 
	  steered the offering of several collegiate courses. The first two
	  years leading to the degree of Bachelor of Science in Agriculture
	  (BSA) was initially offered. This was followed by the two-year 
	  course leading toAssociate in Agricultural Technology (AAT) in 1973,
	  then the complete course offering of Bachelor of Science in 
	  Agricultural Education (BSAE) in1975 and the BSA curriculum 
	  developed by the Technical Panel for Agricultural Education (TPAE)
	  based at Los Ba√±os, Laguna was adopted by the school. This gradually
	  replaced the BSA curriculum as well as the BSAE.The continued 
	  offering of collegiate courses, in addition to the secondary 
	  curriculum which was offered since the founding of the school, made
	  MINAS a full-fledged college hence, the change of name from MINAS to
	  MCAT was approved on June 10, 1976, by then Secretary Juan L. Manuel
	  of the Department of Education, Culture and Sports. It was converted
	  into StateCollege and is now MinSCAT by virtue of R.A. 8007 on May 
	  25, 1995.The leadership of MinSCAT as an educational institution has

	  Mr. Jeremias A. Ortiz as Administrator-OIC (1991-1994), Dr. Angelito
	  A. Bacudo as Principal-OIC (1994-1996). The reorganization of 
	  MinSCAT as a State College through theable leadership of Dr.
